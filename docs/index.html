<h1>VPL Teacher Tools</h1>

<p>This document explains how to install the teacher tools on your computer. You should follow the instructions in one of the following sections, depending on your operating system and your experience with Python.</p>

<h3>Mac</h3>

<p>Follow the link below and download the most recent .dmg file, double-click its icon to mount the image, and copy <em>VPL3Server.app</em> (maybe shown as <em>VPL3Server</em> depending on your settings) to a convenient location on your Mac, such as the Applications folder or the Desktop.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/epfl-mobots/vpl-tt-distrib/releases/">https://github.com/epfl-mobots/vpl-tt-distrib/releases/</a></p>

<p>At least the first time, the Mac is likely to complain that the application represents a security risk. To open it anyway, control-click its icon, choose Open in the contextual menu; in the dialog, click the checkbox to not show warnings again if there is one, and click Open. Repeat once if it fails.</p>

<p>Should it still fail, install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/">Python&nbsp;3</a>, download the most recent <a href="#generic">generic version</a> below, uncompress the zip file, and double-click <em>launch_mac.command</em> (maybe shown as <em>launch_mac</em>).</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>We don't have yet a packaged application for Windows. You should install Python&nbsp;3 unless you already have it (we suggest the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">official distribution</a>, but <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda</a> is a popular alternative if you intend to use Python beyond VPL; if you're asked, check the checkbox <em>Add Python 3.8 PATH</em>).</p>

<p>If you're used to pip, the package installer for Python, download the most recent <a href="#whl">whl file</a> below and install it with pip (in a command window, type something like <code>python3 -m pip install vpl3tt-201021-py3-none-any.whl</code>). Then start the teacher tools with something like <code>python3 -m vpl3tt</code></p>

<p>Otherwise, download the most recent <a href="#generic">generic version</a> below and uncompress the zip file. To start the server, double-click <em>launch_windows.bat</em>. It will download and install required libraries if needed.</p>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>Make sure Python&nbsp;3 is installed (type <code>python3</code> in a terminal, ctrl-d to quit). See <a href="#whl">below</a> to download and execute the whl file with pip.</p>

<h3 id="whl">PIP package</h3>

<p>PIP is the package installer for Python. It takes care of additional libraries the teacher tools depend on.</p>

<ul>
<li>Download the last whl file at <a href="https://github.com/epfl-mobots/vpl-tt-distrib/releases/">https://github.com/epfl-mobots/vpl-tt-distrib/releases/</a>.</li>
<li>Move the whl file to the directory where you want to run it.</li>
<li>In a terminal, change to that directory.</li>
<li>Type the following commands. The first one is to install the Python packages and should be done once. It will fetch other Python packages from the Internet if needed. The second command launches the teacher tool server.</li>
<pre>
python3 -m pip install vpl3tt-201021-py3-none-any.whl
python3 -m vpl3tt
</pre>
</ul>

<h3>Generic</h3>

<p>Zip files are just the text files of the teacher tools with Python source code, the teacher tools with their web user interface, VPL 3, and a few data files. They can be run on any computer which supports Python 3 and its distribution system PyPI.</p>

<p>Zip files can be found at the same place, at <a href="https://github.com/epfl-mobots/vpl-tt-distrib/releases/">https://github.com/epfl-mobots/vpl-tt-distrib/releases/</a>.</p>

<h3>Database format change</h3>

<p>If release notes indicate that the database format has changed, please delete file vplserver-db.sqlite in your home directory manually. You will loose all its content, including the pupil names and the files. To preserve the pupil names, you can export them with your current version of the VPL Teacher Tools, delete vplserver-db.sqlite and upgrade the VPL Teacher Tools, and import the pupil names in the new version. Likewise for the teacher files, you can export them with the current version and reimport them with the new version.</p>
